### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Quinn, a Software Developer. I studied at Fordham University and graduated with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics. I studied a range of topics like philosophy, film, and fiction. After my graduation, I enrolled in App Academy, a top coding camp, to expand my techincal knowledge and skills in web development. Over 4 months, I learned a plethora of skills including React/Redux, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and NodeJS. Besides learning technical skills, I met some of the nicest and most hardworking people, and learned how fun and productive collaborating with great people can be.   

When I'm not coding, I like to play tennis, solve Rubik's Cubes as fast as I can, and read fiction.
